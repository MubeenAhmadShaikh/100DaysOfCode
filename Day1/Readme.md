## Hello folks ðŸ‘‹

- This is the first day of 100DaysOfCode challenge worked on a simple countdown timer.
- Followed along with @developedbyed 's tutorial.

#### ðŸš§ Added some extra things

- Countdown was displaying in negative once crosses the last second so added condition and then clearInterval method.
